# Iterator Design Pattern: Behavioral design
* Given a collection, one should not care abount it structure
* And, should be able to traverse through the elements.
* For example, I should not care whether ypu will give me a list, array, arraylist, set etc
* I should just be able to traverse without minding the type/structure of the underlying collection.
