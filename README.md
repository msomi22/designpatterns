# Design patterns made simple. 
* **What is a design pattern?** design patter is a practical, proven, general, repeatable/recurring  solution to a commonly occurring design problem.
* Categoris of design patterns
   1. Creational  - objects creation/instantiation. 
        * Examples
        * Simple/static factory, Factory method pattern, abstract factory pattern, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool, and Prototype etc.
   2. Structural - organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
        * Examples
        * Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and Proxy etc. 
   3. Behavioral  - identifying common communication patterns between objects.
        * Examples
        * Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor etc.
        
## Important note
  * SOLID design principle.
  * Robert C. Martin/Uncle Bob introduced the SOLID principle.
  * The specific principles were introduced by specific people. 
## What is SOLID?
  * S : Single responsibility principle
       - Introduced by Robert C Martin.
       - A class should have one and only one reason to change, "do one thing and do it well".
  * O : Open-closed principle
       - Introduced by Bertrand Meyer. 
       - Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  * L : Liskov substitution principle
       - Introduced by *Barbara Liskov* in 1987.
       - It states that: 
       - An object of a superclass should be replaceable by objects of its subclasses without causing issues in the application. 
       - A child class should never change the characteristics of its parent class.
  * I : Interface segregation principle
       - Introduced by Robert C Martin
       - A client code should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.
       - Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
  * D : Dependency Inversion Principle
      - Introduced by Robert C Martin
      - Objects/entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. 
      - The high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
