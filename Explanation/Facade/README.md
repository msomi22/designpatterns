# Facade Design Pattern: Structural Design 
* facade - French origin meaning frontage or face
* What is Facade Design Pattern? 
* Used mostly at the client side/front facing side.
* To hide/mask/reduce the underlying complex code
* Provide simple interface.
* If you ask the Gang of four, facade provides an unified "single unit" interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
* This way, facade defines a high level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
