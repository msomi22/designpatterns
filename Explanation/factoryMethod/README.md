# Factory Method Design Pattern: Java implemenation
* Based on inheritance 
* Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
* One factory is specialized in creating only one kind of object. 
* Subclassing determines type of concrete object to return.  
* Factory class implement an interface/protocol with a create menthod. 
* Factory class can produce only one kind of object. 
* Provide a contract/method to create an object.   
* Handle configurations and dependencies well.
