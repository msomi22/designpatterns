# Abstract Factory Design Pattern: Java implemenation
* Based on composition
* Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
* Contains an abstract class that can produce a familiy of different kind of objects.
* Create abstraction for factories using interface/protocol.
* Each factory is specialized in creating a kind of object/factory of factories.
* One generalized factory contains one or more specialized factories each producing a kind of object.
* Dependency injection
* factory of factories
* common abstract/interface 
* subclasss create the object
