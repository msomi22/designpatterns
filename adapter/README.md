# Adapter Design Pattern: Structural Design
* Take two/more **incompatible/unrelated/uncommon** Interfaces.
* Make the communicate/"work together" via a bridge interface "the adapter".
* In other words, the adapter makes them compatible without modifying the original code.

## Related patterns are 
- *Facade - Hide underlying complexity*
- *Porxy - Intercept and control access to underlying logic*
- *Decorator - Adds behaviour*

```
Imagine that you have type A charger and you want to charge your type C phone!
You can buy an adapter that woul help you convert type A to Type C.
