# Decorator Design Pattern: Structural Pattern
* Instead of modifying the original object/inner most.
* We write a wrapper object "the decorator".
* Below is a diagramatic representation of decorator pattern.
* We can have more than one decorator objects.

* We are adding new behavior/functionality  to the original/existing object, dynamically, without affecting/altering it original/existing behavior/structure.
* Remember that...
* Inheritance is not for code reuse/sharing behaviour, it is a way of using composation, rather than inheritance in order to share behavours.
* This concept will be useful here.
